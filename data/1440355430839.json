You better believe it! Our LightSail-Gazing Kit has been big a hit, and so we’ve worked with our friends at Celestron to offer a deluxe kit with additional products to ensure that you are ready to get eyes-on LightSail during its 2016 voyage. You’ll still get the FireCel portable power technology from our friends at Celestron, and the Planetary Society picnic blanket and tote bag, so you can watch the skies in comfort and get it all there in style. To that we are adding Celestron’s COMETRON 12X70 astronomical binoculars, the stylish and functional Liberty LightSail water bottle (for cold or warm liquids, it’s equally valuable on warm or cold nights), a LightSail lens cloth adorned with an image of your astronomical viewing target to remind you of what you are looking for, and Celestron’s SkyPortal Mobile App so you can identify planets, stars and other satellites while on your evening stargazing excursion. On top of all of that, you still get: \n●\tBackers-only email updates\n●\tDigital Donor badge to share via social media\n●\tCENTIMETER OF SAIL rewards\n●\tYour name to space.","estimatedDelivery":"2016-05-01","estimatedDeliveryISO":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","numWords":181,"numAllCaps":7}],"updates":46,"comments":949},"errors":{}}
