You'll also receive one GEEK, a GEEK t-shirt, and updates and direct communication with our engineering team. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and our Geeks Templar will be relied upon heavily. Blog, tweet, vlog, and post all about your experience so others can feel like they're part of the fun, too... but we know they're not. ;)","estimatedDelivery":"2013-11-01","estimatedDeliveryISO":"2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","numWords":108,"numAllCaps":4},{"amount":5000,"backers":1,"pledgePercentage":0,"limited":true,"description":"We have something very special planned for you, you saucy minx. First, you're going to get, of course, a GEEK. Then, you're going to get two official GEEK t-shirts. Then, you and one special friend are going to be our guests at CES 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada. We're going to put you up in a fancy Las Vegas Strip hotel room for three nights (January 7-10), and we're going to get you two Exhibitor passes to the convention. Then, you and your guest are invited to a catered, two-hour experience in our suite at the Venetian Hotel where you'll get to listen to a $500,000 hand-built stereo system... the system that inspired us to create GEEK in the first place. That's what you're going to get. Boom. (Airfare and meals are not included. Neither is any of the other stuff you'll do in Vegas but won't tell anyone about. We'll help you get your GEEK on, but we won't help you get your freak on.)","estimatedDelivery":"2014-01-01","estimatedDeliveryISO":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","numWords":166,"numAllCaps":5}],"updates":55,"comments":944},"errors":{}}
